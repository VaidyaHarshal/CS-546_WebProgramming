            <h2>My Biography</h2>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in the heart of Maharashtra and grew up a very outgoing and active child. Always staying proactive, I ventured into a lot of different activities to show my talent. I was a part of the beta team in my early elementary school years. In high school, I joined a group called Focus that opened the door for mentoring and helping others at an early age. I was also a part of a CPS group called Harris Fellows, which helped develop pilot programs related to high school academics. As part of this group, I traveled to various schools, many of them outside of Maharashtra, to study student issues. Our objective was to gain a better understanding of how programs could be developed to best solve student needs.

                I aspire to receive a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Stevens Institute of Technology. My major is Computer Science. I want to become an Software developer so that I can take my many talents to the next level and take control of the future technology. My desire is to reach toward a higher standard and prove to myself that I have the talent and skills to realize my dreams, while also setting a positive example for those that come behind me.
